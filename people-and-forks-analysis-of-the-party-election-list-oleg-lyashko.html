<h1>Peace however, isn't necessarily a goal that is unifying More than half of Ukrainians are against the peace plan of Poroshenko in an earlier poll. But the Poroshenko bloc is likely take the majority in the 26th October election.</h1>
<p>
The inclusion of a variety of people on the list of party members could result in the next legislature could become a battleground in which the deputies compete for control. The issue is how Poroshenko is able to bring together the many needs that are sure to be represented in the new parliament and also reform the economy of Ukraine and negotiating an agreement that lasts for a long time with Russia.</p>

<p>A large number of parties on the list is likely to mean that the next legislature will turn into an open-ended battle.</p>
The system of mixed elections means that half of MPs are elected from single-member districts and the other the other half will be chosen from lists of parties - in addition to the reality that only one main group (the Poroshenko bloc) is likely to dominate the new Rada will mean that the parliament will be more divided than everbefore, as the party blocs are likely to be able to claim more "centralised" will.
<p>
It is becoming apparent that radicals will control the majority members in the new Rada. According to polls, the possibility of six other parties joining into the new Rada, for example, the Radical party made up of famous people, fighters and musicians, civic activists and sportsmen as well as lesser-known businesspeople. Much like Lyashko's political party, Batkyvshchyna is highly populist and pro-war. Ukrainian female flight pilot Nadia Savchenko is number one on the Batkivshchyna's list of candidates. The sister of her is running and she is highlighting the lengths Tymoshenko is willing to go in order to win popular support. The right-wing Svoboda is also likely to gain support as the turnout in the western part of Ukraine in the region, in which the party's support is mostly based, is likely to increase over in other parts of the country. </p>
